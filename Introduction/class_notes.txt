Angular:
-------
    - Angular is the platform introduced by google.
    - Angular used to develop web applications as well as mobile applications.
    - AngularJS / Angular1.x / Angular1.6.6 is a one of the flavour of Angular Platform.

AngularJS:
----------
    - AngularJS is the framework under the Angular Platform.
    - AngularJS is a javascript framework.
    - AngularJS is a client side javascript framework.
    - AngularJS follows MVC Design Pattern
        M - Model
            javascript variables called as Model
        Ex.
            let data = "Data From DataBase Soon...!";
        [Note : where "data" variable called as Model]
        V - View
            HTML / HTML5 used as View

        C - Controller
            javascript functions called as controller.
        Ex.
            function ctrl(){
                return "data from database soon...!";
            }
        [Note : where "ctrl" called as controller in angularjs]

Advantages Of AngularJS
-----------------------
1. AngularJS Supports Modules (Predefined Modules & Custom Modules)
[Module : collection of predefined functionalities called as Module]

    1.ngAnimate
            - this module used to develop the animations in angular applications.

    2.ngStorage
            - this module used to work with the storages.
                    1. local storage
                    2. session storage

    3. ngMessages
            - this module used to work with the form validations.

    4. ngRoute
            - this module used to implement the routing in single page applications.
            - ngRoute Module is the predefined module given by angular framework.
            - ngRoute Module is deprecated module.

    5. ui.router
            - this module used to implement the routing in single page applications.
            - ui.router module is the 3rd module.
            - now a days all most all the projects using ui.router module to
              implement routing in single page application.

Ex.
    implement the angular application with the following features
    1. form validations
    2. routing in single page application by using ui.router module
    3. storages support
    4. animations support
index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="myApp">

    <script
       src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js">
    </script>
    <script>
         var app = angular.module("myApp",["ngMessages",
                                            "ui.router",
                                            "ngStorage",
                                            "ngAnimate"]);
    </script>
</html>


2. As a angular Developer we can work on HTML DOM
    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.
Ex.
    copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using html & javascript.
index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <div id="first_div">Hello</div>
    <div id="second_div"></div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("second_div").innerHTML =
        document.getElementById("first_div").value;
    </script>
</html>
[Note : as a html developer we must dependent on javascript to work with html DOM]

Ex.
    copy the data from "one div" to "another div" angular js.

index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
    <div ng-model="first_div">Hello</div>
    <div ng-bind="first_div"></div>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

1. angular framework (angular.min.js) file starts the execution from "ng-app" directive
2. "ng-model" directive creates the object internally (heap memory) with
    application data.
3. "ng-bind" directive binds the application data(model data) to view.

[Note : as a angular developer we can manipulate the DOM without depending
        on javascript]

3. AngularJS Supports Two Way Data Binding.
-------------------------------------------
    Automatic Data Synchronization between model and view with the super vision
of controller called as Two Way Data Binding.



in the above diagram we have following service calls:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. http get request
    - this request used to fetch the data from database.


2. http delete request
    - this request used to delete the particular record from database.


3. AJAX Call
    - this request used to overcome the data inconsistency.

[Note : as a programming language developer we must make above all server calls
        to meet application requirement
        Ex.
            Java
            dot net
            php
            --
            --
            --]
[Note : as a angular developer we can make only two server calls to meet application
        requirement
        Ex.
            AngularJS
            Angular5
]
[Note : because of "two way data binding" we can reduce the burden on server]



4. Open Source Code
-------------------
    - We Can Customize the framework accroding to application requirement.
    - because of open source code sharability of angular framework will be increased.


disadvanatges of angularjs:
---------------------------
1. Secuirity
    - we are implementing the business components at client side automatically
we are missing the secuirity by using angular framework.

2. understanding the angular applications are difficult because lack of coding
   standards.


3. client should enable the javascript then only angular applications will execute.


key features of angularjs:
--------------------------
1. directives
    - directives in angular enhances the HTML Capabilities.

    - we have two types of directives.
        1. predefined directives

        2. custom directives

predefined directives
---------------------
    - the directives given by angular framework called as predefined directives

Ex.
    ng-app
    ng-model
    ng-bind

custom directives:
------------------
    the directives developed by developer based on application requirement called as
custom directive.

Ex.
    my-dir

2. single page applications.
    - loading one template to another template without refreshing the whole web page
called as single page application.

    - loading one template to another template in single page application called as
routing.

    - we can implement the routing by using following modules

        1. ngRoute
        2. ui.router

    - ngRoute module is the "native module" and "deprecated module".

    - "ui.router" module is the 3rd party module and have more advantages compared
      to ngRoute Module

    - now a days all most all the projects they are using "ui.router" module
      to implement the routing in single page application.


3. services
    - we can develop the services by using angular.
