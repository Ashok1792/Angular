                  AngularJS - reactJS

What is AngularJS ??
--------------------
    - AngularJS is the Framework.

    - AngularJS is the Client Side JavaScript Framework.

    - AngularJS Follows MVC Design pattern.
        M - Model
        Ex.
               var data = "Data from DataBase Soon...!";
        [where "data" variable called as model in angular js]

        V - View
            - HTML / HTML5/JADE As Recomended as View in AngularJS

        C - Controller
        Ex.
            var fun_one = function(){
                return "data from database soon...!";
            }

        [Note : where "fun_one" called as controller in
                angular js]

        - AngularJS released by google.


Advantages of AngularJS
-----------------------
1. AngularJS Supports Modules.

[Module : collection of predefined classes implementation]

1. ngAnimate
    - this module used to develop the Animations.


2. ngMessages
    - this module used to handle to the form validations.


3. ngStorage
    - this module used to perform the manipulations on
    client side storages.

    - we have two types of storages.

        1. local storage

        2. session storage


4. ngRoute
    - this module used to implement the routing in
single page application.

    - ngRoute module is the default module.

    - ngRoute module is deprecated module.

    - now a days no body using ngRoute module to implement
      Single Page Applications.


5. ui.router

    - ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

    - ui.router module used to implement the routing
      in single page applications.

    - ui.router module have so many advantages compared
      to ngRoute module.

    - now a days all most all the projects they are using
      ui.router module to implement single page applications.


Ex_1:
    develop the angular application by using following
features.
    - Animations Support
    - Storages Support
    - Routing Support (ui.router)
    - Validations Support

index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("app",["ngAnimate",
                                        "ngStorage",
                                        "ui.router",
                                        "ngMessage"]);
    </script>
</html>


2. by using angular js we can manipulate the DOM.
   DOM Stands for Document Object Model

Ex.
    copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using
HTML & JavaScript.

index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div id="div_two"></div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
        document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>

[Note : as a javascript developer we must dependent on
        script to manipulate the DOM]



Ex.
    copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by
using angular js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
    <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

- in the above application we have following directives

    1. ng-app
    2. ng-model
    3. ng-bind

- angular framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

- when ever framework encountered ng-model directive automatically
  object will be created in heap memory with application data.

- ng-bind directive binds the application data(model data) to view.

[Note : we can manipulate the DOM Elements without depending
        on JavaScript.

        As a angular developer we can manipulate the DOM
        by using Angular Directives]

3. AngularJS Supports Two Way Data Binding.

    - Automatic Data Syncronization between model and view
      with the supervision of controller called as
      Two Way Data Binding.




    - in the above diagram we have following server calls.

1. http get request

    - this request used to fetch the data from database.


2. http delete request

    - this request used to delete the perticular resource
from database.


3. AJAX Call

    - this request used to sync the data between view
      and database.

[note : as a programming languages developer we must make
        above all server calls to meet application
        requirement]

[note : as a angular developer we can make only two server
        calls to meet application requirement because of
        two way data binding.]


[note : two way data binding reduces the burden on the server]


4. AngularJS Reduces Burden on the Server.

    - As a Angular Developer we can implement the Business
Components at client side automatically we can reduce the
burden on the server.

5. Open Source Code
    - We can customize the framework accroding to application
    requirement.

    - we can add the features to framework.
    - we can update/delete the features from framework.

Disadvantages of AngularJS
--------------------------
    - we are missing the secuirity because we are implementing
business components at client side.

    - no coding standards given by vendor , so understanding
of angular applications are difficult.

    - as a angular developer we must enable the javascript
in browser.


key features of angular js
--------------------------

1. directives

    - directives in angular enhances the HTML Capabilities.

    - we have two types of directives.

        1. predefined directives

        2. custom directives

    predefined directives
    ---------------------
        - The Directives given by the framework called as
    Predefined Directives.

    Ex.
        ng-app

        ng-model

        ng-bind

    custom directives:
    ------------------
        - The Directives developed by developer based on
    application requirement called as custom directive.


    Ex.
        my_dir


2. services
    - services in angular js used to share the common
    business logic to multiple controllers.

    - by using services we can reuse the business logic.

    - injecting the service to controllers called as
      dependency injection.

    - we have two types of services.

        1. predefined services

        2. custom services

predefined services
-------------------
    - the services given by the framework called as
predefined services

Ex.
    1. $http

    2. $q


custom service:
---------------
    - the services developed by user based on application
requirement called as custom service.

Ex.
    my_service



3. filters

    - filters are used to format the data accroding to
application requirement.

    - we have two types of filters.

        1. predefined filters

        2. custom filters

predefined filters
------------------
    - The Filters given by the angular framework called
as Predefined Filters.


1. orderBy

2. limitTO


custom filters:
---------------
    - The Filters developed by developer based on application
requirement called as custom filters.

Ex.
    my_filter


4. single page applications
    - loading one template to another template without refreshing
the whole web page called as single page application.


5. routing
    - loading one template to another template in single page
application called as routing.

    - we can implement the routing in single page application
by using following modules.

    1. ngRoute
    2. ui.router


Comparision of AngularJS with Angular4:
---------------------------------------
    - The Vendor for the AngularJS is Google.
      The Vendor for Angular4 is Google and Microsoft.


    - By using AngularJS, we can develop web applications
      By using Angular4 we can develop web and mobile applications.


    - we can develop angular js applications by using javascript.
      we can develop angular4 applications by using TypeScript.

    - AngularJS is Controller Based Applications.
      Angular4 is Component Based Applications.

    - AngularJS Have Poor Performance compared to Angular4.
      Angular4 have 5X More Performance Compared to AngularJS


Comparision Of AngularJS With NodeJS:
-------------------------------------

    - AngularJS is the client side scripting language.
      NodeJS is the server side scripting language.


    - We Can develop angular js applications by using
      JavaScript.

      We can Develop Node Applications By Using JavaScript.


    - by using AngularJS, we can develop web applications.
      by using NodeJS, we can develop both http & tcp servers.


Comparision Of AngularJS With ReactJS:
-------------------------------------
    - AngularJS is the JavaScript MVC Framework.
      reactJS is the JavaScript library.


    - while working with data structures angular shows poor
      performance.

      while working with data structures react gives more
      performance.
